# Templates and routes

Blot gives you control over the routing of requests to your blog. The manner in which URLs map to site content is known as routes.

When a request from the internet make it to your blog, Blot first checks if there is a file in your blog's folder which matches the request's path.

If there is no match, Blot proceeds to your theme's routes. Blot works its way down the list of your theme's routes and attempts to find a match.

If it does not find a match, Blot will check your blog's list of redirects.

Finally Blot will render your template's error page if it has one.

# Route ordering

:tag -> adds a list of entries with that tag to your template's variables
:folder -> adds the contents of the folder within your blog folder to your templates variables.
:date -> must match a

# Custom route parameters

Route: /echo/:test
---

<p>Your parameter is '{{params.test}}'</p>
````

When you visit /echo/hello, you'll see this:

<p>Your parameter is 'hello'</p>
