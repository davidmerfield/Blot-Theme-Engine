Before you touch Blot's template system you need your blog's contents and you need a good idea of how your blog should present that content. Your contents should be stored in a folder in a way that makes sense to you. Blot is designed to work with your preferred organization, rather than the other way around.

themes are stored against their folder name,
can contain spaces, is case sensitive.

template files are server at theme/*name*/*file* regardless of whether the user has enabled local editing or not


# Working with static files

You can add static files to your theme's folder. Blot will leave them alone. If you want to reference them in your template, please prefix their path with the variable {{theme}}. For example, if you theme contained two files index.html and style.css, you could add style.css to index.html with this snippet:

```
<style src="{{theme}}/style.css">
```

You can create sub-folders and sub-sub-folders inside your theme's folder, just remember to include them when referencing those files in your templates.

It is a good idea to use absolute paths references to static files. It is not a good idea to include your blog's domain.
