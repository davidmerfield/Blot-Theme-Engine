--- how do we add pagination to any list?

	{{#page tagged:tag}}
		{{#entries}}x
		{{#next}}
		{{#previous}}
		{{#total}}
  {{/page tagged:tag}}

blog.template = 'template-subfolder' === /themes/$blogID/template-subfolder

if the user renames the template, rename the folder then change blog.template if it was the blog's active template

themes / BLOG ID / theme ID

the template compiler always reads from

  / themes / blogID

it will re-render every theme on change? or can we get it to re-render a single theme?

good idea?

the syncer needs to check if a path matches /themes/* and if the blog has local editing enabled

what about files with errors? should we save the file to disk and show the error? in the meantime, the blog will show an error. the template editor should try and catch obvious ones before letting a save through. It would be nice if the blog would continue to use the 'previous good version'?

if (local editing is enabled globally?)

  write files from themes / theme ID
  synchronize any changes from blog / themes
  to themes / blogID / *

  if you delete a folder, the theme will go with it

  if you add a folder, the theme appears

else

  read template from themes / blogID / *
  on save template, save to disk

-----------

should templates inherit a default route or not?

like style.css > /style.css
like archives.html > /archives
like index.html > /
  - would then need to specific /page/:page
like search.html > /search

if you DO NOT define a route, then blot will serve it
at /theme/*name*/file.html

blot will automatically process text based files under a certain size

-----------

design page

list of all templates, blot and custom. errors from the template compiler are surfaced if the user has enabled local editing.

  > clicking on button to create a template

    choose a name and template to clone then submit:

      if local editing, write new folder to /themes
      and tell the user.

      if not local editing, write to folder to /themes/blogID
      and

  > clicking on blot template

    takes to full template page
    you can customize the template here
    and enable it for your blog.

    - customizations are stored as json in the
      database? or on disk somewhere?

    of this template to customize

  > clicking on custom template

    shows any available customization options

    - customizations are stored as json in db?

    theres a button to choose it as your template

    has an edit button which takes you to the template
    editor or shows a page explaining where the template source files
