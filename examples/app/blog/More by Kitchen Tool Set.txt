# More by Kitchen Tool Set

![Image](/image.jpg)

Sebastien Lordez designed the sleeve of More, the second album by French band Kitchen Tool Set. The compact disk is wrapped in an inner sleeve and then packed as a fine food product with a cardboard adorned by a delicate and fluid script typeface on the front. On the back, information about the band and the tracks are set in Helvetica â€” just like on food packaging.
